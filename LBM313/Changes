rom Mohit’s original 11/9/2014 netlist
Added C31 a 100uF cap across the battery
Additional changes from physical design feedback (11/12/2014)
1)      Removed net N$28 because there was nothing attached to it.
2)      Removed battery (CR2032H) from netlist (only holder should be on netlist because it is the only component that gets wired in).
3)      Changed battery holder pins:  G2.2 is tied to GND net, and G2.1, G2.3 are tied to VSS net.
4)      Added JP2, a component for the 4 pads on bottom that will connect to Berkeley printed circuitry.  Pins 1 & 2 go to ECG pads and 3 and 4 to Thermister.
5)      Added TP040 for the 0.040” testpoints.  These get treated like components.  I put one on each net requiring a testpoint and added two for GND.  8 testpoints total; TP01 – TP08
Thanks for the battery holders and BT PWB.  I will make a small mockup of the holder and flap.
